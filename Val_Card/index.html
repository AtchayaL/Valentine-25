                <p>
                    It was lunch break, I first met you in that pathway, waiting for me, “anything atchaya wants” made me fall for you more and that’s how it all started..<br>
                    You wore blue, I wore brown top, I met you for the first time, I found you really attractive, cute and handsome, you complimented my skin and I blushed.<br>
                    We texted and texted, we got to know each other, I never texted anyone that much but I waited for a text from a person I met for the first time on a Monday..
                </p>

                <div class="timeline-date">25th April 2023 - the day I fell for you</div>
                <p>
                    It was free hour for me but you bunked. It was a rainy day when it's supposed to be sunny on summer.<br>
                    We walked all the way to main canteen. “You know the weather is nice..maybe we could go for a long drive” The blush matched with my top colour..pink.<br>
                    “Are you kidding me no mohamed” is what I said but I still followed you like a lost puppy.<br>
                    We went to parking, you opened the door for me, “You know you are the first girl who got inside my car and that too sat on the front seat after my mom and sister” this is what you told me.<br>
                    You always ask me when I fell for you right? I knew I was in love when I followed you to parking..
                </p>
